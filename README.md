# CBManager

A clipboard manager that saves your last 10 times you copied something.
This was made mainly because I wanted to add some more [Windows 10 functionalities](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/clipboard-in-windows-10-c436501e-985d-1c8d-97ea-fe46ddf338c6) back to Windows 7.

## Features

- Saves the last 10 times you copied something.
- You can copy a block of text back to the Clipboard.


## Installation
There is no installer, just run the program. But if you want it to start it automatically when Windows starts: 
- Place the executable in a safe place
- Start the program
- Right-click on the tray icon
- Select "Start With Windows"

## How to Use It
